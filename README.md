# persian-sentiment-analysis-using-fastText-word-embedding-and-pseudo-labeling
In this project, an attempt has been made to reduce the need for pre-processing using fastText word embeddings (skip-gram method) and thus avoiding the complications of Persian language pre-processing. Then, using the deep learning model convolution neural network, high accuracy in sentiment analysis has been obtained. Roughly 30% of data was unlabeled, which implementing pseudo-labeling on that helped to increase the model performance. In this repository fastText training steps haven't been mentioned, and just its pre-trained word embedding vectors have been used in the deep convolutional neural network.

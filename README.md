# persian-sentiment-analysis-using-fastText-word-embedding-and-pseudo-labeling
In this project, an attempt has been made to reduce the need for preprocessing by using fastText word embeddings (skip-gram method) and thus avoiding the complications of Persian language preprocessing. Then, using the deep learning model convolution neural network, high accuracy in emotion analysis has been obtained. Rouphly 30% of data was unlabeled, which implementing pseudo labeling on that helped to increase the model performance.
In this repository fastText training steps haven't been mentioned, and just its pretrained word embedding vectors have been used in deep convolutiona neural network.
